# PetKitAIO

Asynchronous Python library for PetKit's API.

This is PetKit's undocumented API. With that said, future changes made by PetKit may break this library. The API endpoint used is determined based on the region your account is locked to. See the `Regions` section for available region values.

## Important

PetKit accounts can only be logged in on one device at a time. Using this library will result in getting signed out of the mobile app. If you want to continue using the mobile app, use the family share feature to share devices to a secondary account.

> [!NOTE]
> The secondary account may be used with this library. However, be aware that this library was created with a primary account - using a secondary account with this library will work, but I can't guarantee that all features will work. 


This package depends on [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) and [tzlocal](https://pypi.org/project/tzlocal/). `Python 3.7` or greater is required.

### Creating Client
___

```python
import asyncio
from petkitaio import PetKitClient
from aiohttp import ClientSession

async def main():
    async with ClientSession() as session:

        # Create a client using PetKit account email, password, and region
        client = PetKitClient('email', 'password', session, 'United States')


        ####################################################################################
        Examples within the examples section utilize the PetKitClient instance created above
        ####################################################################################



loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())
```

## Examples

### Retrieving all PetKit devices on account

```python
# See model.py for details regarding Data Classes created

devices = await client.get_petkit_data()
```

### Manual Feeding
```python
# See model.py for details regarding "Feeder" class


# Reusing retrieved devices from above. Note: A valid amount (in grams) will depend on the capabilities of the feeder.
await client.manual_feeding(feeder=devices.feeders[feederid], amount=10)
```

### Change Feeder Setting
```python
# See constants.py FeederSetting class for available settings
# Additional import needed:
from petkitaio.constants import FeederSetting


# Enabling child lock on a D4 feeder. Note: Mini Feeders use a different setting.
# Reusing retrieved devices from above.
await client.update_feeder_settings(feeder=devices.feeders[feederid], setting=FeederSetting.CHILD_LOCK, value=1)
```

### Reset Feeder Desiccant
```python
# Reusing retrieved devices from above.
await client.reset_feeder_desiccant(feeder=devices.feeders[feederid])
```

### Control Water Fountain via BLE Relay
```python
# A valid relay (set up through the PetKit app) is required in order to send commands to the Eversweet 3 Pro
# See constants.py W5Command class for available commands
# Additional import needed:
from petkitaio.constants import W5Command

# Set Water Fountain to Smart Mode. Reusing retrieved devices from above.
await client.control_water_fountain(water_fountain=devices.water_fountains[water_fountain_id], command=W5Command.SMART)
```
